# Nimbus Notes — Starter Repo (Generated ZIP)

This ZIP contains a ready-to-upload repository scaffold for Nimbus Notes (Electron + Expo + React).

**What to do next (short):**
1. Download this ZIP to your device.
2. Extract the ZIP and upload the contents to a new GitHub repository (create repo → Upload files).
3. Add the required GitHub Secrets (SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET, EAS_TOKEN).
4. Push to `main`. GitHub Actions will run and produce build artifacts (.exe in electron/dist and Expo builds on EAS).

More detailed instructions are inside the repo after you upload.
